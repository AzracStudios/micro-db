# Micro DB

Micro DB is a small database system. It has the bare-minimum functionality to get a backend database up and working. It allows for:
- Creating tables
- Adding rows
- Updating existing rows
- Deleting existing rows
- Fetching rows by returning matches at specific columns

It does not support any sort of foreign key handling. The database is written to the disk with the file extension ".microdb", and the data itself is plain json.
